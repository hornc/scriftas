# scriftas

Utility to produce SVG glyphs of Old Italic scripts, and similar.

For use in generating families of similar styled and scaled glyphs for representing Old Italic variant characters where regional variants and particular inscriptions of interest differ from what is available in Unicode.

Developed to fill in the gaps on Wikipedia's https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Italic_scripts#Alphabets_related_to_Etruscan

Oscan _scriftas_ = Latin _scriptae_  (nom. pl.)
